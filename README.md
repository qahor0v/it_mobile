## Requirements

To install the following components, please follow the React Native guide for your platform

- Android >= 8.1
- Node >= 11.10.1
- [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger)
- yarn (>1.16.0)
- React Native >= 0.61

## Development

### Read the docs

- [Contributing Guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Git Basics](docs/git-basics.md)

### Environment setup

1. Follow the steps of the official [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.60/getting-started) to setup your development environment. Since we are using native modules, we need to follow the `React Native CLI Quickstart` guide.

### Updating libs

> ⚠️ Beware of the libs used which contain native code. Some of them are highly dependent on the React Native version and might not be compatible with newer ones.
